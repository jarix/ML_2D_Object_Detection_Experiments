# ML_2D_Object_Detection_Experiments
Deep Learning Experiments on 2D Object Detection

The root directory python environment uses PyTorch

The `object_detect_with_tfod_api` subdirectory has its own virtual environment and uses TensorFlow

in each folder create a new virtual environment with command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

or update an existing virtual environment with command:

`pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`
